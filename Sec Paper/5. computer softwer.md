### Computer Software

**1. Relationship Between Hardware and Software:**
   - **Hardware:** The physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices.
   - **Software:** The programs and operating systems that instruct the hardware on how to perform tasks. Software translates user commands into operations executed by the hardware.

**2. System Software:**
   - **System Software** manages and operates hardware and provides a platform for running application software. It includes:
     - **Operating Systems (OS):** Software like Windows, macOS, and Linux that controls hardware and provides services for application programs.
     - **Utility Programs:** Tools for managing hardware components and system performance (e.g., antivirus software, disk cleanup tools).

**3. Application Software:**
   - **Application Software** performs specific tasks for users. Examples include:
     - **Word Processors:** For document creation (e.g., Microsoft Word).
     - **Spreadsheets:** For data organization and analysis (e.g., Microsoft Excel).
     - **Web Browsers:** For internet access (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox).

**4. Compiler:**
   - **Compiler** is a software tool that translates high-level programming languages into machine code that the computer’s CPU can execute. This process enables the creation of executable programs from source code written in languages like C++ or Java.

**5. Names of Some High-Level Languages:**
   - **High-Level Languages** are programming languages that are more abstract and easier for humans to read and write. Examples include:
     - **Python**
     - **Java**
     - **C++**
     - **JavaScript**
     - **Ruby**

**6. Free Domain Software:**
   - **Free Domain Software** refers to software that is available for use without charge and often with open-source licensing, allowing users to view, modify, and distribute the source code. Examples include:
     - **LibreOffice:** A free office suite.
     - **GIMP:** An open-source image editing tool.
     - **Audacity:** A free audio editing software.
