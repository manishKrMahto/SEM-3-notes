### **Number Systems and Logic Gates Overview**

**Number Systems**

1. **Decimal Number System (Base-10)**:
   - Uses digits 0 through 9.
   - Example: 254 (2*10² + 5*10¹ + 4*10⁰).

2. **Binary Number System (Base-2)**:
   - Uses digits 0 and 1.
   - Example: 1101 (1*2³ + 1*2² + 0*2¹ + 1*2⁰).

3. **Octal Number System (Base-8)**:
   - Uses digits 0 through 7.
   - Example: 345 (3*8² + 4*8¹ + 5*8⁰).

4. **Hexadecimal Number System (Base-16)**:
   - Uses digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F (A=10, B=11, etc.).
   - Example: 2F3 (2*16² + 15*16¹ + 3*16⁰).

5. **Inter-conversion**:
   - **Decimal to Binary**: Divide the number by 2, record the remainder, and repeat for the quotient until it is 0. The binary number is the remainders read in reverse.
   - **Binary to Decimal**: Multiply each binary digit by 2 raised to its position power and sum the results.
   - **Decimal to Octal/Hexadecimal**: Divide the number by 8 or 16, respectively, and convert remainders to octal or hexadecimal digits.
   - **Octal/Hexadecimal to Decimal**: Multiply each digit by 8 or 16 raised to its position power and sum the results.

**Basic Logic Gates**

1. **AND Gate**:
   - Output is true (1) only if all inputs are true (1).
   - Symbol: A ∧ B

2. **OR Gate**:
   - Output is true (1) if at least one input is true (1).
   - Symbol: A ∨ B

3. **NOT Gate**:
   - Inverts the input (true becomes false and vice versa).
   - Symbol: ¬A

**Universal Logic Gates**

1. **NAND Gate**:
   - Output is false (0) only if all inputs are true (1). It is the inverse of the AND gate.
   - Symbol: (A ∧ B)'

2. **NOR Gate**:
   - Output is true (1) only if all inputs are false (0). It is the inverse of the OR gate.
   - Symbol: (A ∨ B)'

**Summary**:
- **Number Systems**: Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal. Know how to convert between them.
- **Logic Gates**: Understand the basic AND, OR, NOT, and universal gates NAND, NOR, which are used to perform logical operations in digital circuits.
